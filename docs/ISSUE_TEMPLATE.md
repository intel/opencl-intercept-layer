## Observed Behavior

(Describe the behavior that you are seeing.)

## Desired Behavior

(Describe the behavior that you would like to see instead.)

## Steps to Reproduce

(Describe how to reproduce the issue.  Some information you may want to include:

* Any Intercept Layer for OpenCL Applications controls you are setting.
* The application you ran.  For large or proprietary applications, it will likely be easier to address your issue if you include a simpler reproducer.
* The OpenCL implementation and device you tested on.
* Your operating system, and any other relevant system information.

Some of this information may automatically be included if you attach your Intercept Layer for OpenCL Applications log, particularly if you set [CLInfoLogging](https://github.com/intel/opencl-intercept-layer/blob/main/docs/controls.md#clinfologging-bool).)
