# Using the Intercept Layer for OpenCL Applications with Chrome Tracing

The Intercept Layer for OpenCL Applications includes support for generating
JSON files compatible with the Google Chrome built-in profiler front end.
This document describes how to use the Intercept Layer for OpenCL Applications
to visualize how an OpenCL application executes using Chrome Tracing.

## Background and Setup

The Chrome Tracing Format is described [here][chrome_tracing_format].

To start up the Chrome Tracing front end, open Chrome and enter
`chrome://tracing` as your "URL".  This should give you a Window that
looks like this one:

## Configuring Chrome Tracing

There are (currently) three Chrome Tracing-related controls for the Intercept
Layer for OpenCL Applications:

* `ChromeCallLogging`: This is the control for tracing OpenCL host APIs.
  It will plot OpenCL calls for each thread of the host application,
  similar to those dumped when `CallLogging` is enabled.
* `ChromePerformanceTiming`: This is the control for tracing OpenCL
  device commands.  It will plot OpenCL commands for each command queue
  created by the application, similar to those dumped when
  `DevicePerformanceTiming` is enabled.
* `ChromePerformanceTimingInStages`: This is a further control that sits
  on top of `ChromePerformanceTiming`(it does nothing when this flag is not
  on). When it is on, it splits up the events into "Queued", "Submitted",
  and "Execution" stages, and reorders the calls approximately by start time.
* `ChromePerformanceTimingPerKernel`: This is a further control that sits
  on top of `ChromePerformanceTiming`(it does nothing when this flag is not
  on). When it is on, it organizes the performance information placed in the
  JSON file on a per kernel name basis. It can be combined with the
  `ChromePerformanceTimingInStages` control for information about event stages.

## Collecting Chrome Tracing Data

After setting some combination of these controls, run your application,
and you should see a "CLIntercept_trace.json" file in your CLIntercept_Dump
directory.

## Visualizing Chrome Tracing Data

After collecting a "CLIntercept_Trace.json" file, simply click the "load"
button in the "chrome::tracing" UI, or drag your file into Chrome.

If all goes well you will see a timegraph like this one:

You can navigate around the timegraph with 'wasd' controls similar to many
popular games: `w` zooms in, `s` zooms out, `a` goes backwards in time,
and `d` moves forwards in time.

Let's zoom in a bit and look at the what's in the timegraph:

When the `ChromePerformanceTimingInStages` flag is also set, the calls are
further split into stages and reorganized; here is what that looks like on 
a timegraph:

## Overhead

Empirically, the overhead of Chrome Tracing is very low.  The difference in
scores between a run of LuxMark without Chrome Tracing vs. enabling
`ChromeCallLogging` and `ChromePerformanceTiming` was less than 1%, and the
trace file size for the 2+ minutes of execution was 26MB. 
Similarly, `ChromePerformanceTimingInStages` does not create a noticeable
performance hit, however the trace file size can be up to 3x larger than
without it.
