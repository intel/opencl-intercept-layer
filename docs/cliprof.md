# cliprof: The Intercept Layer for OpenCL Applications Loader

cliprof is a loader utility to simplify basic application profiling using
the Intercept Layer for OpenCL Applications.

## How to Build cliprof

cliprof is currently not built by default.  To build cliprof, set `ENABLE_CLIPROF`
when generating build files using CMake.  For example:

````
> cmake -DENABLE_CLIPROF=1 ..
````

Some operating systems require additional code in the Intercept Layer
for OpenCL Applications DLL / shared library to function correctly with the
cliprof loader utility.  When needed, this additional code is included when
build files are generated when `ENABLE_CLIPROF` is set.

## How to Use cliprof

To use cliprof, simply run it and pass the application to profile and any
arguments via the command line.  For example:

```
> cliprof executable arg0 arg1 ...
```

cliprof will invoke the application executable with the specified arguments,
and after the application exits the device execution time will be reported
to stderr.

cliprof supports command line arguments to enable additional logging and
profiling functionality. To view all cliprof command line arguments, simply
run cliprof with no arguments.

Additionally, cliprof will retain and pass through most Intercept Layer for
OpenCL applications controls that are set via environment variables or other
OS-specific mechanisms.  The additional controls can be used to modify
execution while profiling, or to add additional information to the report.

## Limitations of cliprof

cliprof is a very easy way to do simple profiling in many cases, but there
are some cases where it will not work.   For more reliable intercepting,
follow the instructions to "globally install" or "locally install" the
Intercept Layer for OpenCL Applications.  In particular, note that cliprof
will not work for applications that dynamically load the ICD loader library
and query for OpenCL APIs.

The cliprof executable must be in the same directory as the Intercept Layer for
OpenCL Applications DLL / shared library.

## Known Bugs

The Windows cliprof occasionally crashes.  This appears to happen more often
with a debug cliprof executable.  Running cliprof again usually executes
successfully.

If you encounter other bugs or issues running cliprof, including the `--debug`
command line argument enables cliprof debug output and may help to
troubleshoot the problem.
