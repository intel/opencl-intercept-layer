## How to Fix an Issue or Add a Feature

If you have an idea how to improve the Intercept Layer for OpenCL Applications:

1. Please share your proposal via a GitHub issue.  This lets others know what
   you're working on and gives others an opportunity to provide early feedback.
1. Implement, validate, and document your fix or feature.  Be sure it doesn't
   break any existing functionality!
1. Test the fix or feature.  You will be asked how you tested your changes when
   you create a pull request.  Many features can be exercised by the [OpenCL
   CTS](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CTS) (Conformance Test Suite).
   Other features should be exercised via specific targeted applications.  Ask
   for help if needed!
1. Submit a pull request with your changes.

After submitting a pull request your contribution will be reviewed.  Your pull
request may be accepted as-is, or additional fixes or modifications may be
required.
